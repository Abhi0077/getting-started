## Getting started with OpenCV and JavaFX

*Computer Vision course - [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it) - academic year 2014-2015*

Two simple projects, made in Eclipse (Luna), for getting started with the OpenCV library (version 2.4.9) and with JavaFX (version 2 or superior).

Please, note that both projects are Eclipse projects, made for teaching purposes. Before using both of them, you need to install the OpenCV library and create a `User Library` named `opencv2` that links to the OpenCV jar and native libraries.
