## Getting started with OpenCV and JavaFX

*Computer Vision course - [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it)*

Two simple projects, made in Eclipse (Nenon), for getting started with the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) library (version 3.x) and with JavaFX (version 2 or superior).

Please, note that both projects are Eclipse projects, realized for teaching purposes. Before using any of them, you need to install the OpenCV library and create a `User Library` named `opencv` that links to the OpenCV jar and native libraries.

A guide for getting started with OpenCV and Java is available at [http://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html](http://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).
